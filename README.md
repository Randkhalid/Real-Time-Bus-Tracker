# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
<img src="RealTimeBusTracker.png">

Track the "Real time" location of a random bus in Boston, Massachusetts. I used the Mapbox API to get the map, and I used MBTA's API to get the real time location of the public bus.

# Roadmap
In the future this will be improved to be a transportation app to make things as easy as possible for our community.
